# ðŸš— Dynamic Parking Pricing â€“ Summer Analytics 2025

An intelligent real-time parking pricing system built using Pathway, Bokeh, and Python. This project was developed as part of the Summer Analytics 2025 Hackathon to dynamically update parking prices based on occupancy data and demand.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

To design a real-time pricing algorithm for urban parking spaces that dynamically adjusts the parking cost based on various parameters such as occupancy and demand. The goal is to improve traffic flow, parking efficiency, and optimize revenue.

           Final Daily Price


Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
- Formula:  
  price = 10 + 0.5 Ã— (Occupancy / Capacity)
- Price is bounded between $5 and $20
- Simple rule-based pricing tied to usage

             Final Dynamic Price
             
Model 2: Demand-Based Dynamic Pricing
- Demand is defined as:  
  demand = Occupancy / Capacity
- Pricing formula:  
  price = 10 Ã— (1 + Î» Ã— demand)
- Î» (lambda) = 0.5
- Price is still clipped between $5 and $20

Visualization with Bokeh

- Real-time line chart showing price updates per day
- Interactive dashboard generated using Panel + Bokeh
- Sorting by timestamp to see daily pricing trend

---

Architecture Flow

1. Load occupancy data via Pathway
2. Stream processed data in tumbling daily windows
3. Apply pricing formula (Model 1 or 2)
4. Clamp the price to be within allowed bounds
5. Plot price output over time

---

How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells in order
3. Final cells will display the Bokeh price dashboard

---

Notes

- Currently, only occupancy and capacity are used.
- Queue length, traffic level, or special days can be added later for Model 3.
- All code and logic comply with Pathwayâ€™s real-time stream model.
